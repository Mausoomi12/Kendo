        <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
        <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of the digital world, cybersecurity has become paramount. Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories. As technology advances, so do the tactics of cybercriminals. To stay one step ahead and protect your digital assets, it's crucial to stay informed about the latest cybersecurity trends and implement effective strategies. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the current cybersecurity trends and provide actionable tips to fortify your online defenses.

            <h2>Cyber Security Trends</h2>
            <h3>1. Rise of Automotive Hacking</h3> 
            <p>Modern vehicles nowadays come packed with automated software creating seamless connectivity for drivers in cruise control, engine timing, door lock, airbags and advanced systems for driver assistance. These vehicles use Bluetooth and WiFi technologies to communicate that also opens them to several vulnerabilities or threats from hackers. Gaining control of the vehicle or using microphones for eavesdropping is expected to rise in 2023 with more use of automated vehicles. Self-driving or autonomous vehicles use an even further complex mechanism that requires strict cybersecurity measures. </p>
            <h3>2. Potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3> 
            <p>With AI being introduced in all market segments, this technology with a combination of machine learning has brought tremendous changes in cybersecurity. AI has been paramount in building automated security systems, natural language processing, face detection, and automatic threat detection. Although, it is also being used to develop smart malware and attacks to bypass the latest security protocols in controlling data. AI-enabled threat detection systems can predict new attacks and notify admins of any data breach instantly.</p>
            <h3>3. Mobile is the New Target</h3> 
            <p>Cybersecurity trends provide a considerable increase (50 percent) for mobile banking malware or attacks in 2019, making our handheld devices a potential prospect for hackers. All our photos, financial transactions, emails, and messages possess more threats to individuals. Smartphone viruses or malware may capture the attention of cybersecurity trends in 2023.</p>
            <h3>4. Remote Working Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>The pandemic has forced many companies to move to remote working, introducing a new set of cybersecurity challenges. Remote workers may be more vulnerable to cyberattacks as they often have less secure networks and devices. As such, organizations must ensure adequate security measures to protect their remote workers, such as multi-factor authentication, secure VPNs, and automated patching.</p>
            <h2>Next Up With Cyber Security Trends</h2>
            <p>These cybersecurity trends in 2023 are bound to have more fear in organizations to stack their security measures. It is expected that organizations will spend more than ever with $100+ Billion on protecting their assets alone this year.</p> 
            <p>With infrastructure security a significant part of almost every organization today, it would be a good choice to start their learning curve in cybersecurity today to become experts for tomorrow. Skilled and experienced cybersecurity are among the highest-paid professionals in the IT industry.</p>

                <h2>Cyber Security Tips</h2>
                <h3>1. Think Before You Click</h3
                   >
                <p>This is one of the most important Cyber Security email tips that you can use and follow regularly to keep your data safe. Stay cautious of the unknown links you receive through emails, messages, or while visiting other web pages that are not secure enough.</p>
                    
                    <p>Clickjacking is among the most common methods used by hackers to gain access to your personal data. Just because you are capable of clicking these links does not imply that you should because if these links are malicious then, it can cause you to lose hefty amounts and can damage your life in several ways.
                    
                    Links in mails in the form of password recovery emails, bank statements, etc. are among the most popular methods used by hackers to trick you and gain your personal information. The fake sites connected to these links are too similar to the real ones where the hackers will get you to provide your personal details and gain access to your account using the same.</p>
                    <h3>2. Use Strong and Varied Passwords</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is another one of the most significant cyber safety tips for users. It may be easy to use and remember the same password across multiple platforms for all your accounts but it makes your account more insecure. You should use distinct passwords for all your different accounts. With this practice, even if a company where you have an account is breached or hackers have gotten access to one of your account credentials, these credentials would not work on other websites.</p>
                        
                        <p>Also, you need to use strong passwords for your accounts as they are important for online security. To make your passwords strong and secure, you can refer to the password policy guidelines of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and consider the following:
                        
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Use passwords with more than 8 characters and a maximum of 64 characters</li>
                                <li> Never make use of the same password twice</li>
                                <li> Use at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and a few symbols other than &, #, _, @, etc.</li>
                                <li> Use passwords that are easy to remember and also, do not leave clues in the open or make them available to the public</li>
                                <li> Change your password often and reset it</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. Use Firewalls and Anti-viruses</h3>
                    <p>
                    Hackers can attack your systems and networks through various methods, such as malware, viruses, phishing attacks, trojans, spyware, etc., to gain access to your data. With the help of anti-virus software and firewalls, your system will be capable of defending itself against these attacks. You need to ensure that your firewall or the software that you are using is updated regularly and prevents such cyber threats before they occur.</p>
                    <p>You can use antivirus software like McAfee, TOTAL AV, Norton, etc., and firewalls, such as NGFW, NAT firewalls, etc. In order to keep your data protected from all possible threats, it is important for you as a user or an employee to have Cyber Security awareness.</p>
